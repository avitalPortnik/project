	<br>
	We would like to give a simple explanation about how our code works .
	<br>
	Our project consists of 2 parts : First we have the Java program which collects and stores 
	all the data about the movies and second we have HTML & JavaScript  
	code to support  the connection to the java project and the visibility of our project. 
	<br><br>
	Let's talk about the implementation of the code:
	<br>
	We used an API key given us by TMDB website which we used to collect all the data about the 
	movies, we focused on the top rated movies on TMDB and went through all the pages in the database 
	to get the information using Unirest requests. 
	<br>
	The data received in a form of Json objects and we processed it and created a Movie object and a 
	Person object. To be able to keep track the amount of male and female in the film industry we mapped 
	the movies according to their release date , and to each person we stored his gender. 
    <br>
	We used the Java Spring framework that allows us to use a controller. The controller waits for requests 
	from the website user (he can choose a decade , a genre and a role which he wants to get the 
	information about) and process the information to send back to the website. 
    <br>
    To process the data  implemented a function that receives the choice of the user and calculates the 
	percentage of men and women for every year in the chosen decade. 
    <br><br>
    At the JavaScript part we used an http requests and sent it to the controller with the choices of the user.
   <br>
    Also, we used a Google Charts tool which provides a way to build the graph according to the information
	given from the controller and visualize it on our website. 
   <br><br>
   In conclusion , during this project we discovered a lot of new features and learned how to use them.
   We hope you will enjoy this project as much as we did!!
